Default !! The player has no abilities.
Fortress !! Pieces that are jumped by a player with fortress will not be removed from the board, rather be put into a state where they are immovable (but still jumpable.)
Conquerer !! Pieces that are jumped are conquered by the player, max. 5 before going back to normal logic.
Traveler !! Your pieces can move twice as far, but jumping sacrifices the piece.
