Default !! The player has no abilities.
Fortress !! Pieces that are jumped by a player with fortress will not be removed from the board, rather be put into a state where they are immovable (but still jumpable.)
Conquerer !! Pieces that are jumped are conquered by the player, max. 5 before going back to normal logic.
Traveler !! Your pieces can move twice as far, but jumping sacrifices the piece.
Buddha !! You now follow the teachings of master Buddha. You must sit in deep thought until the end of the game, where you can 1v1 the last player.
